# RAG Architecture AI Assistant

## Project Overview
We created a simple AI chatbot application in Streamlit specialized in the state of Food Security and Nutrition. 
We implemented it using RAG architecture with the annual reports on Food Security and Nutrition as our dataset, 
creating a LLM-based application interface that answers questions from users based on the data provided.
Refer the report attached for architecture and some sample prompts and responses.
